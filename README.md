# BINGO-Game
This is the BINGO Game for Indians. We all play BINGO game in our childhood. In that game there are two players and each of them made the square box of 25 squares. And the game starts by crossing a number, both of the player will cross that number and this happens until there are 5(horizontal, vertical, diagonally) rows are not crossed.
In this, i have made the game for 1 user only, in which the user will play the game with COMPUTER.
The rules are same here.
I have made two different level in this, i.e. Easy level, in which the user can see his/her BINGO chart, and other is the Hard level, in which the user can't see his/her BINGO chart.
You can try this game and you will become the big fan of it.
